# dark+ darker!

A settings.json file for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) that draws from Swiiip's [Sunset Theme](https://github.com/Swiiip/sunset-theme-vscode).

## concept

I made this because the default Dark+ theme had gotten boring and just wasn't dark enough for my taste anymore. I searched and searched for VSCode extensions that looked better, and I didn't find any that I totally liked. So I went backward and just used a portion of the color customizations in Sunset Theme to override Dark+.

The look is about preventing distractions while still calling attention to things like curly braces, Markdown headers, and of course the cursor.

## installation

Clone the JSON file or copy its contents and put it in your settings.json file, which should be located in the .vscode directory that you're working in.
