# dark+ darker

A settings.json file for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) that draws from Swiiip's [Sunset Theme](https://github.com/Swiiip/sunset-theme-vscode).

I made this because the default Dark+ theme had gotten boring and just wasn't dark enough for my taste anymore. I searched and searched for VSCode extensions that looked better, and I didn't find any that I totally liked. So I went backward and just used a portion of of the color customizations in Sunset Theme to override Dark+.
